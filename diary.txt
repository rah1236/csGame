Today I got more experienced with the Curses library and was able to make it work better for my game, such as getting the cursor to move to a specific position based off which keys are pressed on the keyboard. The next step is to get the class for the player ironed out which includes some of the player attributes that will be expanded upon later, such as direction (still figuring out enums) and velocity. Hopefully next time I can get graphics for the world map working and to follow up I can began hit detection and world generation.

Today I found out that the keyboard.getKey command pasues the program and this early catch caused me to be able not to properly refresh the screen as the program was waiting for a keyboard input. This meant that my character object wouldnt change position until after a keypress and i would have to press another key to refresh? It didn't work properly. Fortunately I did finish up the player class, next will be creating an enemy class, confirming movement code works, and creating shooting code for the player class

today I realized that curses was the wrong choice for the game I want to make, and I will now have to port everything I've done so far into IGIS. Fortunately, Points carry over just fine, so most of the code will still function properly, I just need to make some objects to paint onto IGIS and restructure my classes a little. This came about because I realized that in Curses you need the Cursor to write characters, and since I can't quickly devise a way to draw all the characters in such a way that I'd need a que, and a calculations method, and etc etc etc. It would be 10x easier to switch to IGIS which will handle all the things I dont want to do for me. I completed the Player class, and the Bullet class to an extent, but porting over to IGIS will delay the process somewhat.
